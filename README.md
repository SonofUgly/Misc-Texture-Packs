Starts of HD textures packs. Abandoned. Feel free to do whatever you like with these.

# PSP
## Ratchet and Clank - Size Matters
Only text, bolt counter icon, and some flare effects replaced.
Most of the UI, and a fair bit of characters/enemies/prop textures logged and named.

## Secret Agent Clank
Only text and bolt counter icon replaced.
Not much else logged and named.

## [Liberty City Stories](https://github.com/SonofUgly/LCS-Texture-Pack)
Decent HD UI mod. Uses some textures from the PS2 version of LCS, the PC and Xbox versions of GTA3, replaces some in-game textures with their cutscene counterparts, replaces some LOD textures.

## [Vice City Stories](https://github.com/SonofUgly/VCS-Texture-Pack)
Decent HD UI mod. Uses some textures from the PS2 version of LCS/VCS, the PC and Xbox versions of GTA3, the PC version of VC, replaces some in-game textures with their cutscene counterparts, replaces some LOD textures, and has some new textures.

## [Chinatown Wars](https://github.com/SonofUgly/CW-Texture-Pack)
The text and some UI elements have been replaced. Couple of cutscenes and minigames replaced with the Android version's textures.

# PS3
## [Demon's Souls](https://github.com/SonofUgly/DeS-Texture-Pack)
Text and some icons replaced. Most weapon icons re-rendered at a higher resolution.
Dropped as texture replacement is extremely limited, and there's currently no way to do it via RPCS3.
